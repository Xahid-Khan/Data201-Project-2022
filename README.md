By Team Track Stars (Zahid khan, Perry li, Jiani Wu, Kaishun Yang)



As we all know that COVID has had a huge impact on almost every sector of our economy.
We did not have enough time or resources to cover each sector, so we choose 4 topics, which are :
Effects of COVID on CRIME RATE, Vaccination and DEATH RATE,  on Agriculture And on NZ GDP.


Introduction：
The covid-19 epidemic is the biggest crisis the world has faced since World War II and has had a huge impact on the world, including people's psychology and livelihoods, economic growth and employment, and national governance. Our team will analyze the impact of the total number of covid cases for vaccinations, crime rate, deaths, agricultural and GDP (Gross Domestic Product) in New Zealand.

1.	Find the change of crime rate before and after covid, and thus find out how much influence covid has caused on the general safety in New Zealand.
2.	Find the change of agriculture(livestock) before and after covid, and thus find out how much influence covid has caused on the numbers of livestock.
3.	Find the change of GDP (Gross Domestic Product) before and after covid, and analyse the economic impact of the covid outbreak on New Zealand.
